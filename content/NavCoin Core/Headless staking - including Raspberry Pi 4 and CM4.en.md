title: Headless staking - including Raspberry Pi 4 and CM4

Managing the NavPi through its GUI made managing and staking Navcoin a very simple process. Wanting to use the latest navcore 6.X and moving to a more up-to-date and powerful Raspberry Pi platform made staking more commandline heavy due to the missing GUI component when wanting to stake on a Pi remotely.

Below is a quick and dirty how to on how to move from a NavPi to a headless set up. For this how to I use a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) and the latest version of navcoin 6.x to stake Navcoins, it should work for other Linux based platforms as well.


**Disclaimer**: This how to was made to work with a lot of googeling and asking a ton of stupid questions to the patient Discord members of the Navcoin #navpi-support channel. It may not be the 'only' or 'best' way BUT this is how I was able to get staking working for me.

**Special Thanks to `@salmonskinroll` and `@aguycalled` on Discord. `u/Zane_TLI` on Reddit for this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NavCoin/comments/l8jdcr/staking_with_navcoind_getstakinginfo_return>) and `BuckoNZ` for this [post](https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?t=31824).**

This how to is using the CM4 [CM4104032](https://www.buyapi.ca/product/raspberry-pi-compute-module-4-wireless-4gb-32gb-cm4104032/) but as mentioned above it should work for other Linux based platforms to stake headlessly.

**Note**: 4GB Pi models are minimum but 8GB models are even better.

1. Assumption is you have a running CM4 (how to can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=jp_mF1RknU4)) and ssh access to it


	**Notes**:

	- I am utilizing the `screen` window session manager to keep things running in case you get disconnected. [Here is a quick intro on how to use `screen`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB6Y72DK8mc)

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ screen
	```

	**Note**: When reconnecting to the Raspberry Pi remotely re-connect to the still running window session(s)

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ screen -x
	```

	- I am performing all commands from the /home/pi directory
	- At time of writing the latest version of navcoin was 6.1.0

1. Get the latest Navcoin files from [here](https://build.nav.community/binaries/master/)

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ wget https://build.nav.community/binaries/master/navcoin-6.1.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz
	```

1. Once downloaded untar the tarball file 

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ tar -zxvf navcoin-6.1.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz
	```

1. Bootstrap you wallet

	##### What is “Bootstrapping”? 

	Bootstrapping is the process of adding a pre-synced blockchain from a trusted source to your wallet, allowing you to skip part or all of the blockchain syncing process. See [this article](/navcoin-core/bootstrap-your-wallet/)

	First let's create the navcoin data directory. For more info please see [this article](/navcoin-core/locate-your-data-directory/)
	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ mkdir .navcoin4
	```
	Now we download the pre-synched bloackchain inside the .navcoin4 data directory
	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd .navcoin4
	pi@raspberrypi:~/.navcoin4 $ wget https://bootstrap.nav.community/bootstrap.tar.gz
	```

	**Note**: this may take some time as this file is around 3.3GB in size

	Then we untar the blockchain tarball

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~/.navcoin4 $  tar -zxvf bootstrap.tar.gz
	```

1. This next step is only required if you are moving from a navpi to transfer your wallet to your new headless device

	Copy your `wallet.dat` file from the NavPi data directry `~/.navcoin4/` to the new Paspberry Pi data directry `~/.navcoin4/`

	There are several ways of doing this

	- via ssh secure copy `scp`
	- via SSD card moving the SSD from the old NavPi to the new Raspberry Pi and copying the `wallet.dat` file from there to `~/.navcoin4/`

1. Return to the home folder and start the navcoin server

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~/.navcoin4 $ cd ~
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ navcoin-6.1.0/bin/navcoind -t -daemon -datadir=/home/pi/.nacvoin4 -staking=1 -externalip={IP address} -upnp=0 -rpcbind=127.0.0.1 -rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 -rpcuser=test -rpcpassword=test -upgradewallet &
	```

	**Notes**: 

	- `{IP address}` refers to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi on your network.
	- The `-upgradewallet` is only required the first time you run `navcoind` after you imported your `wallet.dat` file from the NavPi (see step 5) adding the `&` at the end of the command lets the command run in the background - you can bring the command back to the foreground by running `fg %1`. More info on using bash jobs can be found [here](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/job-control-bash-feature-you-only-think-you-dont-need)
	- I am not sure what the `-t` option is and does but I saw it somewhere used and it is not throwing an error, so I left it in.
	- I believe a lot of the options and toggles for the navcoin daemon can be added to the `navcoin.conf` file in the `~\.navcoin4\` directory.

	The navcoin core daemon should now start in the background. Running a navcore client command will display the progress until the daemon is fully loaded and the navcoin client query executes correctly displaying information.

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ navcoin-6.1.0/bin/navcoin-cli getinfo
	```

	When the navcoin daemon is completely loaded the `getinfo` command should display as follows:

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ navcoin-6.1.0/bin/navcoin-cli getinfo
	{
  	"version": 6010000,
	  "protocolversion": 80021,
	  "walletversion": 140000,
	  "balance": 509.85726468,

	  },
	  "publicmoneysupply": "1089969.49763987",
	  "privatemoneysupply": "256076.01769613",

	  "unlocked_until": 1623302921,
	  "paytxfee": 0.00100000,
	  "relayfee": 0.00010000,
	  "errors": ""
	}
	```

1. Unlock your wallet for staking

	To unlock your wallet for staking run the following 

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ navcoin-6.1.0/bin/navcoin-cli walletpassphrase 'XXXXXX' 999999 true
	```

	**Note**: Your wallet password will be stored by bash in your bash history. Run the `history` command and delete the line containing your wallet password with `history -d XXX` where `XXX` is the number of the history line that is being displayed when running the `history` command.

1. Check that you are staking

	Check that you are staking by running the command

	```
	pi@raspberrypi:~ $ navcoin-6.1.0/bin/navcoin-cli getstakinginfo
	{
	  "enabled": true,
	  "staking": true,
	  "errors": "",
	  "currentblocksize": 1000,
	  "currentblocktx": 0,
	  "difficulty": 966769.0598687404,
	  "search-interval": 16,
	  "weight": 50985725640,
	  "netstakeweight": 3151385231514200,
	  "expectedtime": 1854275,
	  "expecteddailyreward": X.XX319001
	}
	```

	When you see `true` for both enabled and staking you are staking Navcoin and good to go!!!

#### Additional Notes

If for some reason troubleshooting of the wallet via GUI is required the qt based GUI can be remotely accessed by running a Xserver on either the remote Linux/Windows/MAC machine. 

I was using [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) on Windows and had to use the following command to be able to start `navcoin-qt` remotely:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1
```

**It should be mentioned that the remote qt X session will get disconnected/stopped when the ssh server connection is closed.**


##### To-do's

- add navcoind daemon startup script to allow for auto starting of the navcoin daemon when OS starts up.
- add additional important navcoin-cli command(s) ie. getstakereport
